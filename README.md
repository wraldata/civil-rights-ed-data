## Education civil rights data
WRAL News analyzed the latest release of the [U.S. Department of Education's Civil Rights Data Collection](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/data.html) set for the [2015-2016 school year](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/crdc-2015-16.html), which contains more than 1,800 data points on every school in the country.

The analysis focused on the disparity of arrest and suspension rates between white and black students in the U.S.

To calculate the enrollment, suspensions and arrests of all students, black students and white students, reporters added totals for each state by combining figures for both students with and without disabilities. The totals excluded disabled students served under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, which the U.S. Department of Education does not break down by racial group.

**Black enrollment** is the percentage of black student enrollment out of total enrollment.

**Suspensions - black** is the percentage of black students suspended out of total suspensions.

**Arrests - black** is the percentage of black students arrested out of total arrests.

**Suspensions per 1,000 white students** is calculated by dividing the number of white student suspensions by white student enrollment, per 1,000 white students.

**Suspensions per 1,000 black students**  is calculated by dividing the number of black student suspensions by black student enrollment, per 1,000 black students.

**Suspension rate factor** is calculated by dividing the Suspensions per 1,000 black students by Suspensions per 1,000 white students.

**Arrests per 10,000 white students** is calculated by dividing the number of white student arrests by white student enrollment, per 10,000 white students.

**Arrests per 10,000 black students** is calculated by dividing the number of black student arrests by black student enrollment, per 10,000 black students.

**Arrest rate factor** is calculated by dividing the Suspensions per 1,000 black students by Suspensions per 1,000 white students.
